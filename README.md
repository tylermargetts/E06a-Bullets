In this exercise I trigged a bullet to fire from the narwhal upon left key press. I then went in the update function and made it so the penguins would die after two hits of 50 damage each, and set the program to end when all of the penguins were killed. I used a collision function to determine when the bullet would hit the penguin, and coded for the bullet to disappear after hitting the penguin.
